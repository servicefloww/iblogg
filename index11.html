                <h2>All Basic Concept of <br> Python</h2>
                <p>Python is a High-level programming Language.It's also a case-sensitive language Python was also used in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Python was created bu Guido Van Rossum in 1970.

                    Why Python
                    Python is used for many reasons.
                    
                    Automation: Python was a very good programming language for automation like the python automated various things like computers, or the Web.
                    
                    Web Scrapping: Python was a very good programming language for Web scraping.
                    
                    Backend: Python was very good Language for Backend like with the help of Django framework he give tools for write backend in python.
                    
                    Aritificial Intelligence: Python is generally used for AI. Ex - ChatGpt was also AI Platform.
                    
                    Machine Learning: Python was generally was used in Ml. Like python have various Libraries For ML.</p>
                    <h2>Revolution of Python</h2>
                    <p>Python was designed to be extensible and allow you to use it as an extension language for other modules and applications that need a programmable interface. It was created in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum.</p>
                    <h2>Loop in Python</h2>
                    <p>Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements. Python provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.</p>
                    <h2>Python For Loops</h2>
                    <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

                        This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
                        
                        With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
